# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Read `guidelines.md` in this folder
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

Use the reviewed copy in this folder: `guidelines.md` (vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines@434b7f9). It contains all the rules and the output format.

Upstream source, for refreshing the copy after reviewing changes:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/main/command.md
```

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Read `guidelines.md` in this folder
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
